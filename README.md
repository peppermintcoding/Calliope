# Calliope

A GPT-2 like model pretrained on solely poetry data. Adapted from [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
This is an educational experiment, loosely based on ideas from the [Tiny Stories Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759). It is adapted to run on a single free cloud GPU (colab or kaggle).


### How to run

This is for the GPU poor. Everything runs on a free instance from Kaggle.

### The Name Calliope

[Calliope Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope)

    Here rise to life again, dead poetry!
    Let it, O holy Muses, for I am yours,
    And here Calliope, strike a higher key,
    Accompanying my song with that sweet air
    which made the wretched Magpies feel a blow
    that turned all hope of pardon to despair
Dante, "Purgatorio", Canto I, lines 7 to 12
